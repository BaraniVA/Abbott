# Budget Quest: School Survival

A school budget management simulation game where you take on the role of a principal managing school finances, responding to teacher requests, and handling crisis events.

## Description

Budget Quest: School Survival is an interactive simulation game that puts you in the challenging position of a school principal with limited resources. Your mission is to allocate your budget wisely, maintain staff morale, and keep the "doom meter" low as you navigate through an academic year filled with unexpected crises and constant demands.

Will you successfully balance the needs of your school, or will your institution face closure due to financial mismanagement?
